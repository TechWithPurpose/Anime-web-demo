# Anime Website Demo (University Project)

This is a demo website created as part of a Web Design course at Ruse University "Angel Kanchev". The project focuses on using core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a multi-page site based on specific layout and feature requirements determined by the student's faculty number.

> ⚠️ The content and interface are in Bulgarian. This project was not intended as a full production site, but rather as a visual and structural demo for an anime-themed website.
